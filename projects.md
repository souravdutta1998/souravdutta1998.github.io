WhenImmunize is a reminder setter app for parents who are willing to know when their child need to be vaccinated.

All one needs to do is register the child's details on the **New Registration** intent, and it will automatically send you reminder notifications when the next vaccination date approaches.

More than one registrations can also be done on the same device. Just remember your mobile number which you use while registering.

Parents can even **login** to see all their next vaccination dates and registration of the child.

**Please note that notifications will be sent at 9 A.M. IST.**
